I am Shipeng Chen (陈诗鹏 in Chinese), an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). I am expected to graduate in 2026. My research interests primarily focus on Machine Learning Systems, with a particular emphasis on efficient machine learning techniques. I am deeply interested in LLM quantization and acceleration methods to improve the efficiency and deployment of large language models.

My academic journey is driven by a passion for developing systems that can make advanced AI models more accessible and practical for real-world applications. I believe that by optimizing these models, we can bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and widespread adoption.

Feel free to contact me at [imchensp@gmail.com](mailto:imchensp@gmail.com) if you'd like to discuss research opportunities or collaboration in these areas!
